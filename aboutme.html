    <center><h1>Who is Hailey Lynaugh?</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Hailey Lynaugh and I'm a senior at Hillcrest High School. I'm an animal lover (shoutout to Sophie, Chloe, Rosie, Scrappy, Bruno, and Oliver!) 
    My favorite TV show is RuPaul's Drag Race, my favorite queen being Sasha Velour (our current reigning!) I've been dating my lovely boyfriend Ben for 3 years, who consistently 
    motivates me to strive for success. Check out his website: bentheperson.github.io.</p>
    <p>When I was a kid, my favorite toy to play with was Barbie. I'd place her and her friends into endless crazy scenarios, nurturing my budding creativity. Consider this website
    an homage to her!</p>
